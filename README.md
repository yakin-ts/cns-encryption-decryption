## Installation

To run this project locally, you need to follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yakin-ts/cns-encryption-decryption.git
    ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory and then navigate to both the backend and frontend subdirectories and install them:**

    ```bash
    cd cns-encryption-decryption
    cd cns-backend
    npm install
    cd ..
    cd cns-encryp-decrypt
    npm install
    ```

## Encryption Algorithms
The project demonstrates the following encryption algorithms:

* One-Time Pad (OTP): A symmetric key algorithm where each key is used only once.
* Triple DES (Data Encryption Standard): A symmetric-key block cipher that applies the DES algorithm three times to each data block.
* AES (Advanced Encryption Standard): A widely used symmetric encryption algorithm.
## Technologies Used
- Backend: Node.js
- Frontend: React.js
- Other Libraries: crypto (Node.js built-in library for cryptographic functionality)
